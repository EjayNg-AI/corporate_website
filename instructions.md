The theme files are found in ./corporate-theme

1. Every request loads two style sheets even though only one actually contains CSS. WordPress always enqueues the file that sits at the root of the theme and is named style.css. In this project that file contains only the header comment while the real rules live in assets/css/style.css and are enqueued again from functions.php. The duplicate request adds overhead and makes it easy to miss editor-side regressions because the blank style.css is also what gets sent to the Site Editor. The simplest repair is to move the whole contents of assets/css/style.css into the root style.css, delete the extra enqueue call and delete add_editor_style; WordPress will then load the same sheet automatically on both the front end and inside the editor. If you want to keep the assets folder for organisation, dequeue the automatic sheet with wp_dequeue_style( get_stylesheet() ) and leave only the custom handle in place.

2. The theme disables core block patterns with remove_theme_support( 'core-block-patterns' ) but the code later tries to register its own patterns by including patterns/sections.php and patterns/navigation.php. Nothing is wrong with creating custom patterns, but removing core patterns here also removes the categories they are defined in. Several of the custom patterns are placed in non-existent categories such as banner, featured and columns, so they never appear in the inserter. Replace the remove_theme_support call with add_filter( 'should_load_remote_block_patterns', '\_\_return_false' ) if you only want to prevent WordPress from pulling patterns from the directory, or register the missing pattern categories with register_block_pattern_category before you call register_block_pattern.

3. theme.json tries to style the outline variation of the Button block via  
   "blocks": { "core/button": { "variations": { "outline": { … } } } }  
   The current schema does not recognise a “variations” node inside block styles, so everything nested under it is silently ignored. Global variation styles must be added with block style variations or custom CSS. Either create a style variation JSON file (block-styles/button/outline.json) or move the rules into normal CSS and target .wp-block-button.is-style-outline.

4. The navigation block attribute hasIcon is no longer used; WordPress replaced it with showSubmenuIcon. When the attribute is present but unknown the block falls back to its default (icons off) and the menu behaves differently from what the theme author intended. Search for "hasIcon":true in header.html, navigation.php and the other pattern files and change it to "showSubmenuIcon":true.

5. HTML5 support for navigation-widgets is requested in functions.php although that feature flag was removed from core. Passing an unknown value does no harm but leaves a PHP notice in debug mode. Delete 'navigation-widgets' from the html5 support array.

6. add_theme_support( 'responsive-embeds' ) is a legacy flag for classic themes. Since WordPress 5.8 the block editor includes this behaviour by default and the flag is ignored. You can safely remove the call to keep the setup routine clean.

7. Several Search blocks specify "width":100 together with "widthUnit":"%". With the block API the expected pair is "width":100 and "widthUnit":"%" only when the unit is px or em. For percentage widths you omit the widthUnit attribute entirely. Leaving widthUnit present leads the editor to fall back to a default width and the block is rendered at 100 px wide in the front end. Remove widthUnit from those blocks or keep widthUnit and set width to the string "100" (100%) to get a full-width search bar.

8. group blocks that receive tagName:"main" are already wrapped in the &lt;main&gt; element emitted by WordPress for every template. On pages that reuse more than one of those templates you end up with nested &lt;main&gt; tags, which is invalid HTML and breaks landmark navigation for screen readers. Change tagName to "div" (the default) or remove the attribute entirely; keep only one true &lt;main&gt; element per template.

9. The Post-Meta template part is declared in theme.json but never inserted anywhere in the site. Core still renders an empty part on every request because it is registered in the manifest. If the part is not used, remove it from templateParts; otherwise include it in single.html and page.html with <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"post-meta"} /-->.

10. All cover blocks rely on remote Unsplash URLs for the background image. When the external domain is blocked, the whole hero area collapses. Either ship a local copy under assets/images and point the URL there or convert the cover image to use the Site Logo block so that the user can change it without editing code.
