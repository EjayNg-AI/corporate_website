1. theme.json is mixing up “settings” and “styles”. The objects you placed under settings.blocks (the button variation called outline and the font-size declaration for core/navigation) are style declarations, not support flags. WordPress silently ignores them, so neither the outline button nor the larger nav font size will ever be output. Move those two objects under styles.blocks instead of settings.blocks, keep the exact same structure, then delete the empty stubs that remain in settings.

2. theme.json lists a template part called post-meta without giving it an area. The schema requires an area value (header, footer, sidebar or uncategorized). Because none is supplied the part can’t be selected in the Site Editor, and Theme Check flags it as an error. Either add "area":"uncategorized" (or whatever is appropriate) or simply remove the entry because the part is never used in any template.

3. patterns/navigation.php hard-codes "ref":4 inside the main navigation block. That number is the ID of a navigation post on the developer’s machine; on every other site it points to nothing and the pattern inserts an empty menu. Delete the ref property altogether so WordPress creates a fresh nav block the first time the pattern is inserted.

4. templates/single.html uses an attribute that doesn’t exist: linkLabel in core/post-navigation-link. The block expects label (string) and showTitle (boolean). The current markup <!-- wp:post-navigation-link {"type":"previous","showTitle":true,"linkLabel":true} /--> renders nothing. Replace linkLabel with label and provide the actual text, for example {"label":"Previous"}.

5. The editor style is hooked to admin_init in functions.php. That hook fires too late for the block editor iframe, meaning assets/css/style.css is not loaded in the editor. Move add_editor_style('assets/css/style.css') into the same after_setup_theme callback where you already declare add_theme_support( 'editor-styles' ); or use the dedicated enqueue_block_editor_assets hook.

6. The pattern for button outline is declared only in theme.json; there is no matching CSS so the variation looks identical to the filled button. Add a CSS rule (e.g. .wp-block-button.is-style-outline …) or drop the variation.

7. index.html prints the full post content inside the query loop by using the post-content block. On an archive page that duplicates the entire article instead of an excerpt, breaking pagination and load time. Remove the post-content block (keep post-excerpt) or move the whole template over to the single template if the intention was to show full posts.

8. Header toggle markup is inserted with the raw HTML block but the JavaScript adds the click listener based on the .theme-toggle selector only on DOMContentLoaded. When the block is edited in the Customizer’s selective-refresh the new button receives no listener. The code tries to correct that but checks data-initialized on the new button, not on the old one, so it never sets the attribute and the listener can be bound repeatedly. Add newThemeToggle.removeAttribute('data-initialized') before binding or simply check for the existence of the attribute first.

9. theme.json defines fluid sizes through typography.fontSizes but the style sheet overrides them with static pixel values (e.g. .hero-title { font-size:2.8rem; }). Either remove the hard-coded values from assets/css/style.css or change theme.json to fixed sizes—otherwise the fluid type feature is effectively disabled.

Fixing the first five items eliminates the genuine run-time errors; addressing the remaining points brings the theme in line with current WordPress best practices.
